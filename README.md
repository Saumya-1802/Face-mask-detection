# Face Mask Detection using CNN (TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV)
This project is a deep learning-based image classification model designed to detect whether a person in an image is wearing a face mask or not. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras, and includes preprocessing with OpenCV and other tools.
ðŸ“Œ Features
CNN-based binary image classifier.

Achieved 91% test accuracy and 0.19 test loss.

Preprocessed and labeled 7,500+ images (with/without masks).
